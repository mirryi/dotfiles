information.

Example:

[source,dhall]
----
let LocalType = ./types/LocalType.dhall

let export
    : LocalType
    = { lockCommand = "xset s activate"
      , monitors = { primary = "eDP-1", secondary = "eDP-1" }
      }

in  export
----

[#profile-config]
=== Profile Configuration (Optional)

The file `{profilelocal}` can be created with color, font, etc. configurations.
It should return the type specified in `{profiletype}[]`.
